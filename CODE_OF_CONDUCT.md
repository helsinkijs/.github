# HelsinkiJS anti-harassment policy

HelsinkiJS is a public community that brings together
attendees of all ages, backgrounds and experience levels.
HelsinkiJS and its organizers want to provide everyone with
a safe space and a pleasant experience at our events and online.
Harassment or bullying of any kind are not allowed at HelsinkiJS,
both in the physical event and on the community’s online platforms.
So please remember to treat other community members with respect.

Examples of harassment include inappropriate or unwanted behavior, such as
insults,
name-calling,
derogatory language or comments about someone’s gender or appearance,
unsolicited or intrusive sexual comments and suggestions,
unwelcome sexual advances,
stalking,
aggressive or intimidating behavior,
unwanted touching or other physical contact.
Anyone can experience harassment regardless of their gender, age or life experiences.
Everyone has their own personal definition on what they experience as harassment,
and it should be respected.

Harassment can be both intentional and unintentional.
Sometimes a joke or a comment you perceive as funny or innocent
can make someone else feel uncomfortable or anxious.
It is important to respect other people and their feelings.
If someone feels that your behavior, actions or words are being inappropriate
or if someone calls you out on it, stop immediately.
Please note that repeated inappropriate behavior or harassment
may result in your permanent removal from our community and barring from future events.

If you are being harassed, tell the perpetrator to stop if you can do so.
If you notice something that might be harassment or that someone else is being harassed,
do not hesitate to ask the people involved if everything is OK and if they need help.

We encourage people to report all cases of harassment to the [HelsinkiJS organizers](mailto:organizers@helsinkijs.org),
even if the situation is resolved without help from anyone.
By reporting all incidents you can not only discuss what happened,
but also help us take the necessary actions to ensure that
HelsinkiJS will become an even safer community for everyone in the future.

This document is based on the anti-harassment policy of Ropecon.
